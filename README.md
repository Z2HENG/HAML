HAML aims at learning versatile and anthropomorphic humanoid motion skills via a single policy from reference human motion data.

#### Introduction
Overview of HAML. During training, the conditional discriminator indirectly regulates the motion state transitions generated by the policy. After the training stage I, a policy network with integrated multiple motion skills is available. This policy is used as teacher policy in the stage II and is trained to obtain a deployable student policy through knowledge distillation.
